# **My Story**

Hello Everyone! My name is **Indrajit Singh** and I am a **Senior Software Engineer** and **AI Researcher**. I love to explore new technologies, learn things and help others learn.

> "I have complete faith in the **focus and the energy** that drives me to do greater things in life and that's my intention and love towards executing any task. Instead of just applying for a job randomly I keep my faith in creating interest and attention towards the job"

I started learning C programming and database concepts during my school days (back in 2008) and since then I have developed a strong interest and knowledge in the field of Information Technology. Those days the resources were very limited to learn these technologies and we were only dependent on teachers & offline library books. As years passed by, I got more involved in learning about computer programming, databases and Linux based operating systems which eventually helped me to choose Information Technology in my bachelorâ€™s.



Right after my college, I got an excellent opportunity to work with Informatica Corporation (Informatica), the provider of enterprise cloud data management solutions. I have been working and gaining experience since then in different tools and technologies such as  ETL, Bigdata, Hadoop and Several other Data Warehousing Technologies. The job profile helped me to understand how data is precious today for organizations and how the organizations can achieve efficiency by using different data processing applications and tools for deriving value into their business.

Besides my Software Engineering role at Informatica, I continue my passion for learning new technologies by attending multiple meetups. My quest for discovering the latest technologies and using them to do meaningful things has never diluted. In search of the knowledge, I found the CellStrat AI Lab community a most suitable for creating value to contribute as a self-taught Natural Language Processing researcher.



As an AI Researcher and Natural Language Processing enthusiast, I got exposure to one of the popular & fastest-growing AI community in Bangalore. I gained experience building really fast and accurate machine learning and deep learning models using Python. It helped me develop a great understanding in Deep Learning concepts and help others teach & learn Data Science.

Most importantly I enjoy doing what I am doing and I choose to be happy regardless of the outcomes. When I am not training my Deep Learning models, I enjoy my free time with family and friends.

### Here are some of the tips that might help you succeed in your journey.

- Be well aware and critical about your goals.

- Set out a plan to achieve your goals.

- 
  A goal without a road map is never achievable hence when you set your goals , set a clear road map.

- Start working on your roadmap and achieve the milestones.

- Give harder challenges to yourself and be detached from the results you get as ultimately your goals matter. (consider everything a learning and failure gives you the biggest learning curve)
